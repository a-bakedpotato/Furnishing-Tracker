Housing and indoor architecture would be far too plain if built like that, and so light yellow bricks are still necessary for the exterior wall panels while tiles or wood flooring are required indoors. Thus, concerns about aesthetics and livability won out over the time savings promised by modular construction. Thus, the architects turned to another form of modular construction design that focused on structure and reserving space for internal piping.\\nOf course, even if the architects succeed, there may not be much demand in Fontaine unless the Fontaine Research Institute is rebuilt â€” which is another complicated issue in itself...","recipe":{"exp":90,"time":57600,"input":{"101002":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101002","count":10},"101318":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101318","count":10}}},"tips":null}}
