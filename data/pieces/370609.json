Still, the living conditions cannot be considered poor by any means, and indeed, it is even known to give people a strange sense of \"peace.\" Older folks enjoying their sunset years and open-minded people who care little for worldly affairs particularly love this place.","recipe":{"exp":60,"time":50400,"input":{"101312":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101312","count":12},"101403":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101403","count":6}}},"tips":null}}
