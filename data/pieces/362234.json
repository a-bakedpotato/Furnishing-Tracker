A must-have for Forest Rangers going on long missions. Supposedly, apart from commonly used tools, emergency rations, and containers to store specimens, the backpack also contains a tent that can be quickly pitched. If the Ranger finds an appropriate resting spot and doesn't need a tent, it can also serve as a thick carpet. Unfortunately, Forest Rangers seldom take this backpack with them due to the item's extreme weight.","recipe":{"exp":60,"time":50400,"input":{"101401":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101401","count":12}}},"tips":null}}
