It is a \"lowest-cost storage solution\" born from the joint efforts of researchers from Vahumana and Amurta, and is intended for fruit and vegetable vendors. Mist Flower Corollas are placed at the bottom of the jar to make sure that the perishable produce can last for many days.\\nHowever, there were cases where a vendor had so much faith in this device that they didn't replace the old Mist Flower Corollas in time.
