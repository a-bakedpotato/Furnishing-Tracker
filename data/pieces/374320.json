It is said that the standard shelves previously used at the Fortress had design flaws that posed a risk of collapse after prolonged use. Therefore, the redesigned shelves intentionally include safety columns to ensure that, should danger arise, the shelves will deform slowly rather than straight up collapse. Of course, improving the design alone is not enough to guarantee the safe use of the shelves. This largely depends on operators adhering to safety regulations.","recipe":{"exp":30,"time":43200,"input":{"101001":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101001","count":4},"101318":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101318","count":4}}},"tips":null}}
