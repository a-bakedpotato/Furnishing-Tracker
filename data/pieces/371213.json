This door frame has its own unique design, which is said to invoke the \"storm clouds\" and represent the great ability of the station to keep the peace all over the land of thunder, and thus speak of its ability to deal with many matters in Inazuma City itself.\\nThat said, few citizens actually pay much attention to these design features.
