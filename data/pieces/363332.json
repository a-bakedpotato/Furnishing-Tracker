Filling it with spices will just about allow it to burn quietly for an entire work day, which also gives it some time-keeping properties. These censers have patterns upon them that have been painstakingly carved over long periods of time by the craftspeople who made them, which often gives people from abroad the impression that they are highly valuable. In truth, they are made in much the same way as the exquisite cups of Sumeru City â€” both have made use of Kshahrewar machinery such that neither the true work hours required nor the prices are too unfriendly to the citizenry. Indeed, this is the medium via which spices have found their way into common homes.","recipe":{"exp":60,"time":50400,"input":{"101001":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101001","count":4},"101002":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101002","count":4}}},"tips":null}}
