It is covered by a metal shell that gives it a lovely, exquisite appearance, and it is both hardy yet not too expensive and thus can be found in the streets and alleys of the Court of Fontaine.\\nThis type of wooden board utilizes a relatively new surface-processing method similar to that which is used in clockwork meka, such that one might call this a classic example of Fontaine Research Institute technology being adapted to civilian applications. However, not all ordinary craftspeople can operate such machines, and engineers are still puzzling over how to make such technical ability more readily available to the masses.","recipe":{"exp":60,"time":50400,"input":{"101001":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101001","count":4},"101319":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101319","count":4}}},"tips":null}}
