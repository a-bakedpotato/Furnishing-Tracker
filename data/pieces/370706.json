To meet certain demands, such as the need to store certain special items, several windows have been built in (a rare sight for the desert) for the sake of ventilation. The artisans have also fitted the inner layer of these windows with iron plates to prevent these openings from becoming weak spots. So long as they are tightly shut, the windows will instead be the toughest part of this structure.\\nAs the ventilation in such buildings is quite good indeed, they have also been used as restaurants or canteens for those on duty. At every meal, the fresh aromas of incense and good intertwine, refreshing the minds of those present for a time.\\nNo matter how many people might be in one of these canteens at any one time, a quiet space will always be saved for the Guardian with heterochromatic eyes, for she is used to eating alone. She eats modestly and has no outsize appetite, and yet her strength is far from ordinary.
