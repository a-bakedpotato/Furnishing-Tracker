It has the advantage of providing a large and comfortable living space. The exterior wall is made of beautiful and economic light yellow bricks that are produced from processed Tearstone. The main frame of the building is made from Cypress Wood supplemented with slag cement, a new material developed by the Fontaine Research Institute before the incident, giving it a very long lifespan.\\nThe Fontaine Research Institute was researching a unique method of construction â€” using a metal frame and cement to create a new wood-free building. These buildings would remain standing even if the Emperor of Fire and Iron caused a ruckus on the roof. However, Fontaine lacks the resources to produce the requisite quantities of metal with high enough load-bearing strength. For this reason, mass production of things such as clockwork meka was given priority for Fontaine's metallurgic resources. In light of this, construction with a metal frame and slag cement has not gained widespread popularity.","recipe":{"exp":90,"time":57600,"input":{"101002":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101002","count":6},"101321":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101321","count":10}}},"tips":null}}
