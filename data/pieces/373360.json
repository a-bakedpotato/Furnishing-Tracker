It was for this purpose that this agile cart was designed. Its body is made out of less dense Adhigama Wood, with metal wheels on either side that possess high resistance against wear and tear, which allows them to operate on less-than-ideal roads for a long time.\\nThese carts are often pulled by Sumpter Beasts, and in emergencies, a portion of the supplies onboard can be jettisoned to be moved by human hands instead. Sometimes, mercenaries will load heavy items onto these carts for strength training. It is said that a certain mercenary with long black-and-golden hair can drag a full cartload faster than 90% of mercenaries can run at full tilt. She herself has given no credence to such rumors, claiming that such a scene would be \"way too comical.\"","recipe":{"exp":60,"time":50400,"input":{"101002":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101002","count":4},"101315":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101315","count":8}}},"tips":null}}
