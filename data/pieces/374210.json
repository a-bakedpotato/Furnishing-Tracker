It is crafted from Ash Wood, a moderately hard material, and features a soft cushion and a backrest that may not be as comfortable as the ones found in certain restaurants, but are still quite comfy and can be considered luxurious for public seating. Such benches are predominantly placed in elevated locations throughout the city. Legend has it that sitting on one of these benches at sunset allows you to hear the melody of the warm breeze as it swirls through the Vasari Passage. This enchanting composition has become known as the \"Passage's Evening Ensemble,\" and various renditions have been performed by numerous musicians, ranging from serene to uplifting. It has become one of Fontaine's most beloved tunes.","recipe":{"exp":60,"time":50400,"input":{"101320":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101320","count":4},"101401":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101401","count":4}}},"tips":null}}
