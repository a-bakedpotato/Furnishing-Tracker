The first floor is used for fast-moving consumer goods with short shelf-life and high volume, where freshness is key, such as fresh fruits and vegetables. The second floor is reserved for the storage of packaged and bottled goods. A cargo lift operated by clockwork meka is installed between the floors to achieve highly efficient usage of the building's space while maintaining the store's operational efficiency, so customers never have to wait too long at the counter to purchase high-quality goods.
