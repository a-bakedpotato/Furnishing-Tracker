Properly-dried Adhigama Wood is used to keep the fire burning brightly for a long time.\\n\"Only valor's flame shall never be extinguished.\"\\nSuch is the proverb that circulates among mercenaries, and you can often find those with a romantic disposition reciting this line to others. Although frustration is inevitable in a warrior's journey, the sight of the flaming campfire can rekindle their will to fight. Therefore, mercenary groups treat camping and fire-building as the top priority in campaigns.\\nSimilarly, putting out hostile units' campfires is also an effective way to demoralize them, especially when it comes to particularly obdurate foes.
