While they generally serve as water tanks now, such barrels were originally designed for the brewing and easy retrieval of large quantities of various liquors that required extended fermentation periods. With the rise in popularity of a new drink called Fonta in Fontaine, the sales of alcoholic beverages have declined, resulting in reduced demand for these casks from the distilleries. Consequently, the barrel manufacturers have had to sell them at a low price to people living in the wilderness who lacked access to the water supply system. This has made these casks one of the most recognizable landmarks in the countryside of Fontaine.","recipe":{"exp":60,"time":50400,"input":{"101321":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101321","count":12}}},"tips":null}}
