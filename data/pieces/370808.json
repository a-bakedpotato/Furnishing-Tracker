Although it has a relatively little storage space, the merchants' living space has been combined with the shop. Two fairly spacious bedrooms are located in the taller four-story tower to the left while the right side is reserved for a lounge space. The integration of commercial and residential buildings is convenient for both local and foreign merchants. The Louis' Fish & Chips snack bar in the Vasari Passage rents this type of building, though its storage space has been expanded and a fully functional kitchen added, allowing them to tirelessly serve their customers and establish themselves as a premier dining establishment in the area.","recipe":{"exp":90,"time":57600,"input":{"101002":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101002","count":10},"101318":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101318","count":8}}},"tips":null}}
