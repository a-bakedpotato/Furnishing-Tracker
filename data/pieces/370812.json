While the colorful walls and decorations are practically the same as other stores, it features sturdier metal and glass, boasting both being \"strong as armor\" and \"100-year rustproof durability.\" Even if a particularly ignorant criminal dared to take a shot at robbing the Confrerie, they would find the windows impervious to their tools. In contrast, even a grocery store's wall would warp if hammered repeatedly.\\nSupposedly, using an identical design as other stores is the confrerie's marketing ploy to attract various consumers. After all, overly lavish storefronts tend to intimidate and discourage customers on a budget. A \"relatively normal\" appearance would make the store seem more approachable, or at least entice customers to come inside and browse.","recipe":{"exp":90,"time":57600,"input":{"101001":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101001","count":12},"101401":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101401","count":6}}},"tips":null}}
