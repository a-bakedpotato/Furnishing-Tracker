Its roofing is quite gently sloped and is enjoined to one wall, which can make it seem a little odd, but there is a special consideration at play here â€” for shots fired from long or middling range, the silhouettes of such barracks are quite small, thus making them less likely to be hit. Even when they are hit, there is a good chance that the projectiles will bounce off the sloped roof. The wood on the roof has been specially treated such that it does not ignite easily, thus effectively invalidating fire-based tactics. The weaknesses of this design, however, are the sizable sacrifices made to interior space and therefore comfort.","recipe":{"exp":60,"time":50400,"input":{"101001":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101001","count":6},"101312":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101312","count":12}}},"tips":null}}
