Instead, their intent is simply to use the white noise from the flowing waterfall to drown out all other ambient noises, thus allowing them to achieve a unique form of \"silence.\"\\nMedical theories from other nations have also indicated that sitting under waterfalls for too long might actually result in some strange trauma injuries.","recipe":null,"tips":null}}
