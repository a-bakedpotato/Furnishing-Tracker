It is said that the flowers turn towards the sun before fully grown, as if absorbing the vibrant hues of sunlight. Many artists have tried to utilize its petals as pigments to paint with the \"most radiant colors.\" Such attempts have ended in failure. Consequently, the Fontaine Standards for Preservation of Flora have categorized this plant as protected, and picking it indiscriminately is strictly prohibited.","recipe":null,"tips":null}}
