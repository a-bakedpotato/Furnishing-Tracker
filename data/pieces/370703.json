The process of making the top of this kind of tent is very exquisite. After being soaked in a decoction made using a secret recipe, the wood is quickly seared in a bonfire lit by the dead branches of the Adhigama Wood to dry quickly, then waterproofed by immersing it in large amounts of water, resulting in a material that can repel insects without a pungent odor, but that is also not easily burnt. Safe and practical, these huts were originally developed by the inhabitants of Vimara Village and are used by the Forest Watchers as shelters when stationed in areas with more abundant rainfall.\\nOf course, being stationed in areas where such shelters are needed is also a test of spirit for the Forest Rangers, who must have a strong sense of responsibility and conviction.","recipe":{"exp":60,"time":50400,"input":{"101315":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101315","count":8},"101401":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101401","count":4}}},"tips":null}}
