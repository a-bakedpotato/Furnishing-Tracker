It is said to have been first designed by researchers to help them camp out in the rainforest for a long time while performing research or cultivation, before then spreading to all parts of Sumeru. The huts are large enough to accommodate more than one person, with plenty of room for furniture, research equipment, and sample storage. \\nThe tents are also a welcome respite for Forest Rangers trying to maintain order. Because the residents often have long-term plans and distinct organizational divisions, there are very few accidents and they do not disturb the rainforest too much. A wooden sign is sometimes hung at the door to welcome visitors.","recipe":{"exp":60,"time":50400,"input":{"101315":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101315","count":8},"101401":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101401","count":4}}},"tips":null}}
