Legend has it that these sakura were once used as a very precious dye that required the collected essence of a hundred sakura trees just to make one kimono. Such an article of clothing was once worth more than precious gems.\\nFortunately, Her Excellency, the Almighty Ogosho, thought little of what mortals might consider \"high-class,\" and set forth a decree ordering sakura trees be protected from being used as dye-making material.
