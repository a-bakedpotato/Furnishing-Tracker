However, this proved ineffective, as most people on the streets were in a hurry and uneager to accept some mysterious piece of paper thrust upon them by a stranger, never mind read it carefully. But just as everyone was at a loss, some promoters noticed that pedestrians sitting on benches were more inclined to read newspapers voluntarily. Therefore, they proposed that newspapers should not be forcibly handed to busy passersby, but should be placed in fixed facilities for people to read at leisure. The book and newspaper racks now scattered throughout the streets and alleys of Fontaine are the concrete realization of that brainwave.","recipe":{"exp":60,"time":50400,"input":{"101321":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101321","count":4},"101401":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101401","count":2},"101404":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101404","count":2}}},"tips":null}}
