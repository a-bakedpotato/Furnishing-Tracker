It is only missing one wooden pole, and shouldn't take much time to complete. Usually, such interruptions in work are a result of monster attacks that force the workers to clear out in a hurry. And when they return, the monsters will often have made off with the pole that would have been used to finish the fence, rendering the work incomplete.","recipe":{"exp":30,"time":43200,"input":{"101308":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101308","count":4}}},"tips":null}}
