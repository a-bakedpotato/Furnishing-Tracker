It is evenly divided into many storage compartments, enough to accommodate most of the supplies that an ordinary home would need. Its original design utilized Athel Wood, which was beautiful and sturdy but somewhat expensive. The switch to Mountain Date Wood allows this design to be reproduced using the ideal materials.\\nOf course, given the high cost and fine workmanship, most people will use this vertical cabinet to store relatively expensive things such as books and delicate accessories. Therefore, some residents also use it as a showcase for their collections and thus place it in a more conspicuous position. \\nLegend has it that a few years ago, some Canned Knowledge smugglers had a misguided idea: to use intuition to hide important items by mixing containers and documents with clutter before storing them in plain sight within such cabinets. At first, this ruse actually fooled some ordinary matra who were following leads, but after the General Mahamatra updated their search procedures, listing all the tricks the suspects had played, all the peddlers who dared deceive the law were soon caught.","recipe":{"exp":60,"time":50400,"input":{"101316":{"icon":"UI_ItemIcon_101316","count":12}}},"tips":null}}
