These buildings are already of a certain \"age,\" but they are far from dilapidated. Instead, they give off a feeling of simple leisure. None of the buildings stand out in particular, and it even seems like they might all blend in with the nearby mountains in a few more years... These are, of course, all the hallmarks of an excellent hiding spot â€” and you can be sure that a certain lazy Shuumatsuban ninja has done just that before, slacking off and sleeping somewhere in an equally sleepy village.","suiteItemList":{"370609":{"rank":3,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Exterior_Dq_Build_House_14_Lod0","count":1},"370610":{"rank":3,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Exterior_Dq_Build_House_15_Lod0","count":1},"371216":{"rank":2,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Exterior_Dq_Build_House_23_Lod0","count":1},"371217":{"rank":2,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Exterior_Dq_Build_House_24_Vo","count":10},"372329":{"rank":3,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Exterior_Dq_Plant_Pt_09_Lod0","count":1},"373130":{"rank":2,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Exterior_Dq_Decoration_Bucket_01_Vo","count":1},"373131":{"rank":2,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Exterior_Dq_Decoration_Cylinder_01_Vo","count":1},"373322":{"rank":3,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Exterior_Dq_Decoration_Carp_01_Vo","count":1},"374109":{"rank":3,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Exterior_Dq_Flower_Tomato_01_Lod0","count":6}},"favoriteNpcList":{"10000053":{"icon":"UI_AvatarIcon_Sayu"},"10000055":{"icon":"UI_AvatarIcon_Gorou"}},"story":{"0":{"id":6905311,"taskData":[{"items":{"690531101":{"type":"SingleDialog","role":"Sayu","text":[{"text":"The terrain in this village is pretty complex.
