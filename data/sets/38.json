The young head chef of the Wanmin Restaurant once shared that to make the traditional dishes of Qingce Village, one must first place dry bamboo chips into the stove and carefully control the flame. If one can process the shrubbery near Wolfhooks into thin firewood, one can even add a little Mondstadt flair in.\\nDifferent kinds of firewood produce vastly different effects, and most chefs will never truly master them. As such, Wanmin Restaurant has a monopoly on this particular technique.","suiteItemList":{"361102":{"rank":3,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Interior_Md_Cabinet_Cupboard_03_Vo","count":1},"361103":{"rank":3,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Interior_Md_Cabinet_Cupboard_04_Vo","count":1},"361305":{"rank":3,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Interior_Md_Table_Cooking_02_Vo","count":1},"361306":{"rank":3,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Interior_Md_Table_Table_22_Vo","count":1},"361311":{"rank":3,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Interior_Md_Cabinet_Cupboard_02_Vo","count":2},"362104":{"rank":2,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Interior_Md_Chair_Chair_20_Vo","count":3},"363101":{"rank":3,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Interior_Md_Lamp_Lamp_04_Vo","count":2}},"favoriteNpcList":{"10000020":{"icon":"UI_AvatarIcon_Razor"},"10000023":{"icon":"UI_AvatarIcon_Xiangling"},"10000026":{"icon":"UI_AvatarIcon_Xiao"},"10000033":{"icon":"UI_AvatarIcon_Tartaglia"},"10000041":{"icon":"UI_AvatarIcon_Mona"},"10000077":{"icon":"UI_AvatarIcon_Yaoyao"},"10000080":{"icon":"UI_AvatarIcon_Mika"},"10000082":{"icon":"UI_AvatarIcon_Baizhuer"}},"story":{"0":{"id":6902051,"taskData":[{"items":{"690205101":{"type":"SingleDialog","role":"Razor","text":[{"text":"Kitchen, ingredients...
