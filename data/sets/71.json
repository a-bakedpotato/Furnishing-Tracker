In theory, at least, this type of encampment can withstand the assault from many foes, and can even form the fulcrum of a defensive line should there be sufficient manpower to do so.\\nNo matter how bothersome the setup and transport of the materials might be, and no matter how the lack of tents that block the wind or rain may lead to rather tough conditions... Battle-hardened mercenaries need only a bed of straw to sleep soundly, and as such do not worry over-much about such small flaws.","suiteItemList":{"372339":{"rank":2,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Exterior_Xm_Plant_Tree_Common_05_Lod0","count":1},"372464":{"rank":3,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Exterior_Xm_Plant_Grass_Desert_11_Lod0","count":5},"373356":{"rank":3,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Exterior_Xm_Decoration_Prop_TentBox_01_Lod0","count":3},"373357":{"rank":3,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Exterior_Xm_Decoration_Prop_Brazier_01_Lod0","count":2},"373358":{"rank":3,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Exterior_Xm_Decoration_Prop_WeaponRack_01_Lod0","count":1},"373359":{"rank":3,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Exterior_Xm_Decoration_Prop_Barrier_01_Lod0","count":7},"373360":{"rank":3,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Exterior_Xm_Thing_Prop_Cart_01_Lod0","count":1},"373361":{"rank":3,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Exterior_Xm_Decoration_Prop_Ybtqizhi_01_Lod0","count":1}},"favoriteNpcList":{"10000079":{"icon":"UI_AvatarIcon_Dehya"}},"story":{"0":{"id":6907907,"taskData":[{"items":{"690790701":{"type":"SingleDialog","role":"Dehya","text":[{"text":"Mercs camping in the wild rely on banners and weapon racks to protect themselves.","next":690790702}]},"690790702":{"type":"SingleDialog","role":"Dehya","text":[{"text":"Normally, any reasonable merc will know to keep their distance when they see another group's banner.","next":690790703}]},"690790703":{"type":"SingleDialog","role":"Dehya","text":[{"text":"However, if a not-so-reasonable person insists on approaching, that's when the weapon racks come in handy.","next":"finish"}]}},"initDialog":690790701}]}}}}
