The design process included considerations as to how guests might feel, and the room itself was designed for them to relax sufficiently, such that they will feel re-energized, as one might after a long, dreaming sleep, even after only taking a short rest. The kotatsu that has been kindly set up also contributes to the feeling of never wanting to leave your room.","suiteItemList":{"361314":{"rank":4,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Interior_Dq_Decoration_Furnace_01_Vo","count":1},"361403":{"rank":3,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Interior_Dq_Bed_Bed_01_Vo","count":1},"362210":{"rank":2,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Interior_Dq_Thing_Cushion_01_Vo","count":4},"362216":{"rank":4,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Interior_Dq_Decoration_Screen_02_Vo","count":1},"363206":{"rank":3,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Interior_Dq_Thing_Pot_01_Vo","count":1},"363316":{"rank":3,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Interior_Common_Decoration_Shipin_02_Vo","count":1},"370114":{"rank":3,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Interior_Dq_Cabinet_Wardrobe_01_Vo","count":1},"373325":{"rank":3,"icon":"UI_Homeworld_Interior_Dq_Decoration_Zhuangshipin_01_Vo","count":1}},"favoriteNpcList":{"10000053":{"icon":"UI_AvatarIcon_Sayu"},"10000054":{"icon":"UI_AvatarIcon_Kokomi"},"10000059":{"icon":"UI_AvatarIcon_Heizo"}},"story":{"0":{"id":6905310,"taskData":[{"items":{"690531001":{"type":"SingleDialog","role":"Sayu","text":[{"text":"Seems like this would make a good safehouse.","next":690531002}]},"690531002":{"type":"SingleDialog","role":"Sayu","text":[{"text":"Y'know, somewhere where it's safe to snooze away undetected.","next":690531003}]},"690531003":{"type":"SingleDialog","role":"Sayu","text":[{"text":"I really like it here.
